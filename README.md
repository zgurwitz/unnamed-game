# Unnamed-game
A 2-D turn based shooter/strategy game.
Written in haskell and UI uses brick.

# Controls:
You are the (@)
Use the arrow keys to move/fire, or 'x' to pass your move. 
Use 'c' to change from moving to firing.
Don't touch the enemies (e) and try to get to the goal (f)!
(0)s are Bullets that you can pick up to shoot at enemies.
(x)s are abstacles. You can't move onto them, but neither can your enemies!
Press (q) to exit at any time"

# Future Plans
If I continue, other items, inventory staying between levels, more enemy ai or and allowing enemies to fire projectiles would be added, and well as more ways to score points other than the 10 for beating a level.
